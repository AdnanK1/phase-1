## Introduction
Microsoft Corporation is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States. It was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Microsoft is known for developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, hardware devices, and services.

Microsoft's primary product is the Microsoft Windows operating system, which is widely used in personal computers around the world. Windows has evolved over the years and now powers various devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Additionally, Microsoft offers a suite of productivity software, including the widely used Microsoft Office suite, which consists of applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

## Problem Statement
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

By analyzing the prevailing box office performance, we can gain valuable insights into audience preferences and tailor our movie production strategy accordingly. These insights will guide decision-making processes, ensuring that Microsoft's movie studio creates films with a higher likelihood of commercial success.

## Specific Objective
The objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis on the "im" database in order to provide the company with statistical data. This analysis aims to offer valuable insights on which genres the studio should focus on to enhance their performance and receive favorable ratings. By examining the data and applying statistical techniques, we can provide the studio with meaningful recommendations regarding the genres that have the potential to improve their overall quality and attract positive audience reception.
